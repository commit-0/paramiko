        Ask the server for a hash of a section of this file.  This can be used

        The file is hashed from ``offset``, for ``length`` bytes.
        If ``length`` is 0, the remainder of the file is hashed.  Thus, if both
        ``offset`` and ``length`` are zero, the entire file is hashed.

        Normally, ``block_size`` will be 0 (the default), and this method will
        return a byte string representing the requested hash (for example, a
        string of length 16 for MD5, or 20 for SHA-1).  If a non-zero
        ``block_size`` is given, each chunk of the file (from ``offset`` to
        ``offset + length``) of ``block_size`` bytes is computed as a separate
        hash.  The hash results are all concatenated and returned as a single
        string.

        For example, ``check('sha1', 0, 1024, 512)`` will return a string of
        length 40.  The first 20 bytes will be the SHA-1 of the first 512 bytes
